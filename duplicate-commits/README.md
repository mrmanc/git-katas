This was inspired by a question about why duplicate commits sometimes appear in the commit log. [This Stackoverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9264314/git-commits-are-duplicated-in-the-same-branch-after-doing-a-rebase/30927009#answer-30927009) has some useful explanation of a similar situation.

### Working on feature branch

```mermaid
%%{
  init: {
    "gitGraph": {
        "mainBranchName": "master"
    }
  }
}%%
gitGraph
    commit id: "Say hello"
    commit id: "Say hello world"
    checkout master
    branch feature
    checkout feature
    commit id: "Start new feature"
    commit id: "Continue feature"
```

## Fix made on master

```mermaid
%%{
  init: {
    "gitGraph": {
        "mainBranchName": "master"
    }
  }
}%%
gitGraph
    commit id: "Say hello"
    commit id: "Say hello world"
    checkout master
    branch feature
    checkout feature
    commit id: "Start new feature"
    commit id: "Continue feature"
    checkout master
    commit id: "Fix urgent typo"
```

## Incorporate fix into feature

```mermaid
%%{
  init: {
    "gitGraph": {
        "mainBranchName": "master"
    }
  }
}%%
gitGraph
    commit id: "Say hello"
    commit id: "Say hello world"
    commit id: "Fix urgent typo"
    branch feature
    checkout feature
    commit id: "Start new feature (2)"
    commit id: "Continue feature (2)"
```

## Pushing feature branch

Git wonâ€™t let us push as the feature commits have been recreated so the history has diverged.

```shell
 ! [rejected]        feature -> feature (non-fast-forward)
error: failed to push some refs to '../exercise-remote.git'
hint: Updates were rejected because the tip of your current branch is behind
hint: its remote counterpart. Integrate the remote changes (e.g.
hint: 'git pull ...') before pushing again.
hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.
```

So we run `git pull`, and it does this.

```mermaid
%%{
  init: {
    "gitGraph": {
        "mainBranchName": "master"
    }
  }
}%%
gitGraph
    commit id: "Say hello"
    commit id: "Say hello world"
    checkout master
    branch feature
    checkout master
    commit id: "Fix urgent typo"
    checkout feature
    commit id: "Start new feature (3)"
    commit id: "Continue feature (3)"
    commit id: "Fix urgent typo (2)"
    commit id: "Complete feature"
```

## Merge feature into master

We want to release our feature, so we merge our branch in. Now the duplicate commit appears in the log for master.

```mermaid
%%{
  init: {
    "gitGraph": {
        "mainBranchName": "master"
    }
  }
}%%
gitGraph
    commit id: "Say hello"
    commit id: "Say hello world"
    checkout master
    branch feature
    checkout master
    commit id: "Fix urgent typo"
    checkout feature
    commit id: "Start new feature (3)"
    commit id: "Continue feature (3)"
    commit id: "Fix urgent typo (2)"
    commit id: "Complete feature"
    checkout master
    merge feature
```

```shell
$ git checkout master && git --no-pager log --oneline --no-decorate

8ed0e39 Merge feature into master
45f34bf Complete feature
faebc00 Fix urgent typo
ad7eaaa Fix urgent typo
7ac59d1 Continue feature
f28c8cb Say hello world
f567cf9 Start new feature
5d99ac2 Say hello
```
